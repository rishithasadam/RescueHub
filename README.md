RescueHub
Overview
RescueHub is a disaster response and community interaction application designed to enhance disaster relief efforts through the integration of satellite imagery, geospatial information, and environmental data. The app utilizes machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict high-risk areas, coordinate response efforts, and monitor user safety in real-time during disasters such as floods and wildfires.

Features
Location Sharing and Nearby User Visibility: Users can share their location with nearby individuals and volunteers.
Emergency Alert Button: Users can send distress alerts to nearby users and volunteers.
Real-Time Communication: Users and volunteers can communicate via messaging within the app.
Navigation Assistance: Users receive navigation guidance to reach distressed individuals efficiently.
AI-Driven Safety Checks: AI algorithms monitor user movements and environmental data to assess safety levels and provide proactive alerts.
Implementation
Backend Development: Develop backend systems for user authentication, location tracking, and real-time communication. Integrate ML models and AI algorithms for disaster risk prediction and safety monitoring.
Frontend Development: Design an intuitive user interface with features for location sharing, emergency alerts, messaging, and navigation. Integrate AI-driven chatbots for automated assistance.
Machine Learning and AI Integration: Train ML models using historical disaster data to predict high-risk areas and prioritize response efforts. Implement AI algorithms for safety monitoring and proactive alerting.
Testing and Deployment: Conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability, performance, and security. Deploy the app on app stores and conduct user training sessions.
Community Engagement: Collaborate with local authorities, disaster response organizations, and community leaders to promote the app. Provide training and support to volunteers using the app for disaster response efforts.
Impact
The RescueHub project aims to address societal challenges related to disaster relief by leveraging advanced technologies such as ML and AI. The application is grounded in research and data about disaster patterns and response strategies, with a clear plan to deploy AI models for real-world impact. Expected outcomes include improved disaster prediction, faster response coordination, and enhanced user safety during emergencies.
